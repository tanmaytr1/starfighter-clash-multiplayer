You still need nanoid. The reason you don't see it at the top of the file anymore is because we changed how it's imported to fix the ERR_REQUIRE_ESM error.

Instead of a standard require() statement at the top, the nanoid module is now imported dynamically inside the createRoom function. This was necessary because nanoid is a modern ES Module, while your Node.js files are using the older CommonJS module format.

The nanoid library is still essential for generating the unique, 6-character roomId for each new game. Without it, you wouldn't have a way to create unique room IDs, and your lobby system would not work.

The code is still using nanoid right here:

JavaScript

// Inside your createRoom function
const { nanoid } = await import('nanoid');
const roomId = nanoid(6);
